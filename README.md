# webscraping
Make sure you download and place the driver geckodriver.exe in your Python installation directory.
This is necessary for the command: "driver = webdriver.Firefox()"

This is my first time performing a web scrap.

My intention is to learn how to do it and then move forward to collect more data from internet and fill out databases, prepare batch jobs, etl processes, graphs and practice  exercises related to data engineering.

For today I am satisfied.
Time to go and sleep
